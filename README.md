# ADPT — Agent-based Defect Pattern Tagger

This repository provides the implementation of **ADPT**, a training-free, agentic annotation framework for structural defect classification using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).

ADPT formulates defect annotation as a multi-stage reasoning and verification process, enabling **fully automatic, zero-shot defect labeling** without human-in-the-loop supervision or model fine-tuning.
